- .. see if extra infos are quick

- 



- main site: show latest of all items: forays and howtos


==================================

- optimize search and highlights
	- show those with text found in title first
	- show piece of text in body that was found
- replace all imports with @

- implement unit testing for qtools
- get SEO image to work in Slack
	- seems to be the same as this, which works: view-source:https://vitest.dev
	- see seo.html
	- main reason:
		- works on Whatsapp
		- works at: 
		- Slack does not load: https://tanguay-eu.vercel.app/images/tempsiteicon.png
		- but Slack does load: https://vitest.dev/og.png
	- it seems that Slack now blocks images from Vercel and Netlify
		- but you can link images from tanguay.eu
	- solution: built a process which simply uses the tanguay.eu link
		- even then it seems it won't work
		- I can only get a tanguay.eu image to work from: https://et041-ogimagecheck.vercel.app
