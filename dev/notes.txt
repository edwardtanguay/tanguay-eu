	- get SEO image to work in Slack
		- seems to be the same as this, which works: view-source:https://vitest.dev
		- see seo.html
		- main reason:
			- works on Whatsapp
			- works at: 
			- Slack does not load: https://tanguay-eu.vercel.app/images/tempsiteicon.png
			- but Slack does load: https://vitest.dev/og.png
		- it seems that Slack now blocks images from Vercel and Netlify
			- but you can link images from tanguay.eu
		- solution: built a process which simply uses the tanguay.eu link
