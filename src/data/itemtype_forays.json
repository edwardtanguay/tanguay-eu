observables and promises\n\t- a promise resolves to a single value asynchronously, an observable resolves to (or emits) multiple values asynchronously (over time)\n\t- concrete examples: \n\t\t- promise = response from an Ajax call\n\t\t- observable = a click event\n\t- observables are a representation for a possibly infinite amount of values\n\t- promises are designed to represent AJAX calls\n\t\t- observables are designed to represent anything: events, data from databases, data from ajax calls\n\t- a promise is often a good choice when you want to fetch a single chunk of data\n\t- if your component gets data with only one request it's a good choice to use Promise but if it has a chain of request-cancel-new request you should use observable\n\t- observables provide many values, promises provide one\n\t- ES6 added built-in support for promises to JavaScript\n\t\t- observables were 2017 ECMA proposal that wasn't adopted\n\t- to use promises, use the RxJA library:

asynchronous programming by making the code look synchronous and avoid problems associated with callbacks\n\t- a promise is a container for a future value\n\t\t- like a plane ticket, the ticket is a

becomes more difficult to read\n\t- note: **callbacks are functions, promises are objects**\n\t- handlers passed to `promise.then` don't just handle the result of the previous promise, but rather, whatever they return is turned into a new promise\n\t- chained promises no longer cause callback pyramids, no matter how many levels of callback hell you’d be in for, the equivalent promises code is

As of today, Windows Server 2016 is the only windows system that support native containers, however, the most basic image is 5GB big which is not very efficient.\n\t\t- Windows server runs Windows containers natively and uses Hyper-V for Linux.\n\t\t- Also, when you run Windows Containers you cannot run Linux ones, so you have to choose one or the other. Since 99% of the images are Linux base, and .NET can run on Linux, Windows containers are not that useful.\n\t\t- Use Linux for Containers, it is always the best option.\n\t\t- Windows 10 Pro with Hyper-V is a good option to run in your PC/Laptop, but Linux will always be better\n\t\t- There is no support for Windows containers in most cloud providers or Kubernetes.\n\t\t\t- Apparently with Windows 2019 this is no longer true.\n\t- [article on Docker](https://forums.docker.com/t/hyper-v-or-native-windows-containers/44631)\n\t\t- No, on Windows 10 only Hyper-V isolation is available. The Windows 10 kernel configuration is a little different from the Windows Server kernel configuration, so Hyper-V isolation is required.\n- ok, since Linux is obviously the default and since I can change it later, I left this book unclicked and **will use Linux containers**\n- Docker installed\n- reboot\n- VirtualBox still works, surprisingly\n- but in PowerShell\n\t- `docker version` works\n\t- `docker run hello-world`\n-","extras":"$place=hm","systemWhenCreated":"2020-04-25 11:31:04","systemWhoCreated":"systemUnknown"},{"id":96,"category":"JSON","title":"Import JSON via web with

What is the difference between `undefined` and `not defined`?**\n\t- A variable that is declared (`var x;`) but not defined, will be of type `undefined`.

Differentiate between FLOAT and DOUBLE? **\n\t- Doubles are just like floats, except for the fact that they are twice as large. This allows for a greater accuracy.\n- **2. Differentiate CHAR_LENGTH and LENGTH**\n\t- CHAR_LENGTH is character count whereas the LENGTH is byte count. The numbers are same for Latin characters but they are different for Unicode and other encodings.\n- **3. What are the different kinds of tables?**\n\t- **INNO DB** - SELECT wird schneller ausgeführt, as of MySQL 5.5 the default storage engine, InnoDB has row-level locking. MyISAM only has full table-level locking\n\t- **MyISAM** - Häufiger genutzt und gängigster Standard \n\t- **Heap** - refers to a table created with the MEMORY storage engine, the MEMORY storage engine does not persist any data to disk; it holds data in RAM\n\t- **Merge** - when you create a MERGE table, MySQL creates a . MRG file on disk that contains the names of the underlying MyISAM tables that should be used as one.\n\t- **ISAM** - The original storage engine in MySQL was the ISAM engine, the only storage engine available until MySQL 3.23, Due to the deprecated status of ISAM, and because MyISAM is an improvement over ISAM, you are advised to convert any remaining ISAM tables to MySAM as soon as possible.","extras":"$place=hm","systemWhenCreated":"2020-09-08 01:05:49","systemWhoCreated":"systemUnknown"},{"id":146,"category":"Jenkins","title":"Install Jenkins on Ubuntu","rank":"3.5","body":"- <H|If you just want to install Jenkins quickly, skip down to the sections labeled \"These instructions work\"|H>\n- prepare to install Jenkins\n\t- `sudo su -`\n\t- install Java: \n\t\t- `apt-get -y install openjdk-8-jdk`\n\t- `wget -q -O - http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian-stable/jenkins-ci.org.key | apt-key add -`\n\t- `sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'`\n\t- `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y`\n- install Jenkins\n\t- `sudo apt-get install jenkins`\n\t- `sudo service jenkins start`\n- in browser:\n\t- `http://localhost:8080`\n\t\t- failed: unable to connect\n- VARIOUS: might be helpful\n\t- firewall commands\n\t\t------------------\n\t\tsudo ufw allow 8080\n\t\tsudo ufw status\n\t\tsudo ufw enable\n\t\t------------------\n- installing on Ubuntu Server\n\t- `apt-get -y install openjdk-8-jdk`\n\t- `wget -q -O - http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian-stable/jenkins-ci.org.key | apt-key add -`\n\t- `sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'`\n\t- `sudo apt-get install jenkins`\n\t- `sudo apt-get install Jenkins`\n\t\t- unable to locate\n\t- `sudo apt update`\n\t- `sudo apt install Jenkins`\n\t\t- unable to locate\n\t- OK, NOW TRYING THIS: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-jenkins-ubuntu\n\t\t- `wget –q –O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add –`\n\t\t\t- said it couldn't add \"-\"\n\t\t- `sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list` and add at end:\n\t\t\t--------------------------\n\t\t\t#  Jenkins software repository\n\t\t\tdeb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary\n\t\t\t--------------------------\n\t\t- save with CTRL-O, enter, CTRL-X\n\t\t- `sudo apt update`\n\t\t\t- malformed entry 51 in list file /etc/apt/sources.list (the line we just added)\n\t\t- `sudo apt install Jenkins`\n\t\t\t- malformed entry 51 in list file /etc/apt/sources.list (the line we just added)\n- TRYING AGAIN:\n\t- https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-jenkins-on-ubuntu-18-04/\n\t- (install Java)\n\t- `wget -q -O - http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian-stable/jenkins-ci.org.key | apt-key add -`\n\t\t- ok\n\t- `sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'`\n\t- `sudo apt update`\n\t\t-----------------------------\n\t\tHit:1 http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal InRelease\n\t\tHit:2 http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-updates InRelease\n\t\tHit:3 http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-backports InRelease\n\t\tHit:4 http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-security InRelease\n\t\tIgn:5 https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ InRelease\n\t\tGet:6 https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ Release [2,044 B]\n\t\tGet:7 https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ Release.gpg [833 B]\n\t\tIgn:7 https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ Release.gpg\n\t\tReading package lists...

(Most of the setup and maintenance process is managed from the command line, and technical support is very limited.)\"\n\t- Ok, we definitely want to avoid anything technical. What package would they need to purchase from you in order to be able to install the Moodle version that I did, 3.7.9?\n\t\t- Moodle 3.7.9 should be installable on any Shared, Reseller, or Managed plan that otherwise meets its technical requirements. My recommended starting point is Drive or Turbo Boost (Startup doesn't quite have the necessary muscle for Moodle): https://www.a2hosting.com/web-hosting/compare\n\t- So if they signed up for Shared Hosting Drive, they would be able to install Moodle 3.7.9?\n\t\t- That's correct, though I'd strongly recommend steering clear of Startup for anything heavier than a pluginless WordPress site. The other plan levels will be okay for it. (Startup was designed for static HTML sites, so complex web apps may run slowly -- or even crash -- under its lower CPU limit.)\n\t- Shared Hosting \"Drive\" is $4.99 per month: https://www.a2hosting.com/web-hosting/compare\n- %% was able to log in.\n- setting it set up else where\n\t- [Profihost](https://www.profihost.com), Hannover\n\t\t- They [have MySQL 5.7](https://www.profihost.com/managed-hosting) so one could theoretically install Moodle\n\t\t- asking via e-mail\n\t\t\t--------------------------------\n\t\t\teine technische Frage zu Ihrem Managed-Hosting Paket: https://www.profihost.com/managed-hosting\n\t\t\tIst es möglich Moodle 3.10.1 zu installieren?

January 2022 I was still using create-react-app starter code that I created from an August 2021 build of create-react-app and noticed that it now gets 22 vulnerabilities, one of them being critical##thereactbuls\n\t- so I typed `npm audit` and got more information on the vulnerabilities:##reactgetmoreinforamiotnvuls\n\t- by googling the one critical vulnerability *prototype pollution in immer*, I found many other people concerned about this and trying to fix it\n\t- I found [this fix](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/10412) from February 2021 which advises to **update immer to 8.0.1 to address vulnerability**\n\t- I then saw that that I could apparently fix all the vulnerabilities automatically by typing *npm audit fix*, but this didn't fix any of them##reactnotfixok\n\t- I took further advice listed to type *npm audit fix --force*, notice it says that one package update *involved breaking changes* which sounds ominous ##usedfixforceonreact\n\t- although it said that 3 vulnerabilities could not be updated, typing `npm audit` again showed that there are now only two##nowonlytworeact\n\t- only having 2 vulnerabilities instead of 22, and no critical vulnerabilities, gives one a better feeling of security, particularly if one is working on a production project, but the message that there are now *breaking changes* in this React app is unsettling. \n\t\t- .. to get experience with this, I will now use this build with these fixes and to see if I run into any problems because of these apparent \"breaking changes\"\n- out of curiosity, I installed a fresh create-react-app with `npx create-react-app cra2022-01-23` to see if any of these vulnerabilities had been corrected since my August 2021 package.json\n\t- it seems that there are only two vulnerabilities after a fresh install:##seemsonlytworeact\n\t- and comparing the package.json files from both builds, it seems there was a major update to react-scripts in the last half year:##403to500\n- I wanted to update my blankcra site so that it doesn't have the 22 vulnerabilities so simply updated the version of react-scripts in my package.json file:\n\t- from: `\"react-scripts\": \"4.0.3\",`\n\t- to: `\"react-scripts\": \"^5.0.0\",`\n\t- this seems to work well:##seemstoreactworkwell\n- through researching this, I came upon this critical article on

files from the backend, which is Node, not create-react-app, but apparently Webpack can't make this distinction\n\t\t- see that this breaking change is given explicitly in the terminal##breakingchange\n- ok, since I want both a backend and frontend in one project, and since I don't want to eject create-react-app, I am going to revert back to react-scripts 4.0.3\n\t- deleted `node_modules`\n\t- deleted `package-lock.json`\n\t- change `react-scripts` back to 4.0.3\n\t- `npm i`\n\t- so now I'm back to the critical vulnerabilities##backtocrrrr\n\t- but `npm start` shows the

Gatsby website up and running, including:\n\t- add data to the `gatsby-config.js` file and retrieve it with GraphQL\n\t\t- contentful data and images combine with local JSON file and images all via GraphQL\n\t- install and use SASS\n\t- use MDX Markdown\n\t- add multiple pages with nav menu\n\t- use `<Layout>` to create header and footer that shows on each page \n\t- use `<Seo>` to display page title in tab header\n\t- images\n\t\t- use responsive images\n\t\t- use performance-optimized `<StaticImage>`\n\t- deploy site at Vercel\n\t- make this a template site pinned on GitHub\n\t- there's apparently two ways to build a Gatsby site:\n\t\t- npm\n\t\t\t- `npm init gatsby`\n\t\t\t- it asks you many questions like Vite does\n\t\t\t- e.g. you can select Sass, TypeScript, Contentful\n\t\t\t- but site is quite reduced, simply a **src/pages/index.tsx**\n\t\t- Gatsby CLI\n\t\t\t- `gatsby new the-name-of-your-site`\n\t\t\t- asks no questions, builds a site that has a lot more boilerplate than the nbm install method\n\t\t- my strategy:\n\t\t\t- use the npm version to choose what you want, e.g. TypeScript, Sass, Contentful\n\t\t\t- but set up a Gatsby CLI site and look at the boilerplate, porting what you want over to your npm site\n\t- **NOTE:** Gatsby and Next.js are **React Frameworks** which use the **React library** to build a website\n\t\t- they use **React** just as e.g. **Vite** and **create-react-app** tools use the React library to build a website\n\t\t- however, **Gatsby** and **Next.js** bring a lot more infrastructure to the website which you need for larger projects\n\t\t- learning these two frameworks is different than learning **Angular** or **Vue.js**\n\t\t\t- instead of learning a **new framework** you are learning a **particular set of architecture design, code patterns and infrastructure tools added to React**\n\t\t- even if you end up not using these frameworks, learning them will give you good ideas and patterns how to organize and build React sites in general\n\t\t- one might express this in a metaphor of building a house:##metaphorhouse\n- **past Gatsby howtos and sites made**\n\t- HOWTO: Build a two-page website with Gatsby and

Create simple Gatsby Site <==**\n\t- reading this:https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start\n\t\t- go to project folder\n\t\t- `npm init gatsby`\n\t\t- then you have to answer some questions##youhavetoans\n\t\t- ended with failure, it seems I have Node version **16.15.1** and need at least **18.0.0**:##thendfailsk\n\t\t- that's exactly the case:##1615\n\t\t- and Node is currently at version 18##andnod18\n\t\t- the easiest way to install a particular version of Node is with **nvm**\n\t\t\t- see if you have it installed first##seeifinstalv\n\t\t\t- if not then [install nvm on Linux with these instructions](https://heynode.com/tutorial/install-nodejs-locally-nvm) or [on Windows with these instructions](https://heynode.com/tutorial/install-nodejs-locally-nvm/)\n\t\t\t- after nvm is installed, use `nvm list` see which Node Versions you have locally downloaded ready to install:##seewhichin\n\t\t\t- if **version 18** is not listed, then see which versions are available to be installed with `nvm list available`\n\t\t\t- you want the latest LTS version:##youwantlatest\n\t\t\t- install the latest LTS version and use it with: `nvm install 18.12.1`\n\t\t\t- if you get an error, you may need to use `sudo` on Linux or open the Terminal as Adminstrator on Windows:##installthelatse\n\t\t\t- on Windows as administrator Node can be installed fine##installthelatseonwin\n\t\t- now with Node version 18+ install Gatsby again with `npm init gatsby`\n\t\t- it issues quite a number of warnings but installs with success##manywarnsbuton\n\t- enter directory: `cd et010-gatsby-contentful-etc`\n\t- start VSCode: `code .`\n\t\t- npm modules is already installed so no need to run `npm i` as with Vite\n\t\t- although you will find a **yarn.lock** file in root, Gatsby recommends using **npm**\n\t\t\t- *\"Most tutorials and site development examples from the Gatsby docs use npm. To avoid confusion and possible conflicts with your dependencies, Gatsby recommends using npm for site development.\"* - https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/glossary/yarn\n\t\t- delete **yarn.lock**\n\t\t- start the Gatsby site with\n\t\t\t-----------------------------------\n\t\t\tnpm run develop\n\t\t\t-----------------------------------\n\t\t- then click the link shown in the terminal##thelinksinsterm\n- **==> STEP 2.

StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75267286/why-would-tsc-always-compile-fine-on-windows-but-on-a-debian-linux-deployment-s) and immediately got downvoted##stackdown\n- asked ChatGPT and received a useful, helpful answer:##chatghelp\n- Node versions not the same?\n\t- Debian: 16.15.1\n\t- Windows: 16.18.0\n\t- I upgraded Debian's Node version (with nvm) to 16.18.0 and it still hangs:##windowsdebianhang\n- Debian memory too low?\n\t- 2 GB of RAM\n\t- certainly low end but the sites I am compiling are only a few small files\n\t- [_] upgrade to 4GB RAM?\n\t\t- this costs an extra 4€ per month so this is a last resort only\t\n- permissions?\n\t- the web sites are in my home directory, and 60-80% of the time the tsc command can compile fine\n- network delay or interruption?\n\t- this machine is merely connected to the Internet, no other machines\n- [_] considering what else it could be that causes tsc to hang\n\t- or what kind of script I could write to return it to a state that it gets to when I reboot the machine which enables tsc to compile successfully again\n\t- [x] try [tsc --build --clean](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68144771/whats-the-difference-between-tsc-build-clean-vs-rm-rf-js)\n\t\t- `tsc --build --clean` seems to not create any files at all in the /dist folder\n\t\t- `--clean` is not what I want since [--clean simply deletes the .js files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68144771/whats-the-difference-between-tsc-build-clean-vs-rm-rf-js)\n\t- [_] I could make tests which use `tsc` outside the context of this website\n\t- [_] I could set up this same site and deployment scripts on my Arch Linux Heztner machine\n- **for now the only solution I have is to use tsc as long as it doesn't hang, and when it hangs, reboot the machine and run it again**\n\t- odd: when I reboot the Debian machine, node is always reset to

far with Docker\n\t- Getting up-and-running with Docker\n\t\t- **set up Docker on Ubuntu like this**:\n\t\t\t- uninstall old versions\n\t\t\t\t- `sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc`\n\t\t\t- Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu\n\t\t\t\t- https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu\n\t\t\t- Linux post-installation steps for Docker Engine\n\t\t\t\t- https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall\n\t\t\t- test \n\t\t\t\t- `docker run hello-world`\n\t\t- `docker run hello-world` still works on my Ubuntu\n\t- trying on Windows\n\t\t- `docker run hello-world` works on Windows as well\n\t\t- Ubuntu container can be downloaded and started on Windows##ubunonwin\n\t- checking if Docker is accessible from another Ubuntu account on same machine\n\t\t- logged in as **edwardstudent**\n\t\t- `docker run hello-world` got **docker: permission denied**\n\t\t- fixed this by adding user to the docker group##addeduserfg\n\t- install\n\t\t- docker.com\n\t\t- Get Started\n\t\t- Docker Desktop\n\t\t- installing on Linux\n\t\t\t- using edwardstudent on Dell machine\n\t\t\t- docker.com\n\t\t\t- Download Docker Desktop\n\t\t\t\t- note that Docker Destop on Linux will not recognize images and containers that were made before you install it##notondeksks\n\t\t\t- clicked Ubuntu\n\t\t\t- downloaded DEB package\n\t\t\t\t- note you apparently need Ubuntu 22.04 and not Ubuntu 20.04##note2204ok\n\t\t\t- added to favorites on the side\n\t\t\t- I found a `/home/edward/.docker/desktop` directory\n\t\t\t- working through the tutorial##doingintrodkjsu\n\t\t\t\t- 1. clone repository\n\t\t\t\t\t- has everything you need to build an image##ttstep1\n\t\t\t\t- 2. build an image\n\t\t\t\t\t- there's a `/home/edward/getting-started` directory now##11step2\n\t\t\t\t- 3. create a container from the image and run it##ttstep3\n\t\t\t\t\t- `docker run -d -p 80:80 --name docker-tutorial docker101tutorial`\n\t\t\t\t\t- `-d` = detached mode (in background so you can continue to use the terminal)\n\t\t\t\t\t- `-p 80:80` = specifies internal port to external port\n\t\t\t\t\t- `--name` = name of **container**\n\t\t\t\t\t- `docker101tutorial` = name of **image**##step33oks\n\t\t\t\t- 4. save and share\n\t\t\t\t\t- `gpg --generate-key`\n\t\t\t\t\t- `pass init AAC3...`\n\t\t\t\t\t- then logged in##andnowlodddsjd\n\t\t\t\t\t- and shared##okandshared\n\t\t\t\t\t- it is now in my dockerhub##nowindockshub\n- preliminary todos\n\t- get an account at Docker Hub\n\t\t- this is the same as Docker.com\n\n- why docker from the point of view of a **developer**\n\t- reduces the amount of time it takes to develop, test, deploy and maintain our application **environments**\n\t- organized development environments are better for teams\n\t- a tool that encourages/forces  us to think in terms of microservices when we are developing our applications\n- tutorials\n\t-

loaded first\n\t\t\t\t\t- each part of the page is an isolated unit, and a performance issue in one unit doesn't affect the others\n\t\t\t\t- SSR can actually have a net negative impact on User Experience \n\t\t\t\t\t- sections of that HTML may be missing their client-side interactivity, but the document should at least contain the most essential content\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- a news page’s HTML would contain the article body, and a product page would contain that product’s description\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- all of the other content is secondary to this information, and its inclusion in the HTML becomes a product decision\n\t\t\t\t\t- a website that uses standard HTML links for navigation is easier for assistive technologies and web crawlers to use\n\t\t- multiple islands can exist on a page\n\t\t\t- an island always renders in isolation\n\t\t\t- each island can use any UI framework or just plain Astro code\n\t\t\t- Astro generates every website with zero client-side JavaScript by default\n\t\t\t\t- every time we render an island on a page, Astro automatically renders it to HTML ahead of time and then strips out all the JavaScript\n\t\t\t- to use React components in your Astro project, you have to add the @astrojs/react integration into your project\n\t\t- benefit of Astro islands\n\t\t\t- heavy focus on making your app as light as it can be\n\t\t\t- every island is loaded in parallel\n- Astro supports five client directives:\n\t- `<MyComponent client:load/>`: Hydrates the component JavaScript immediately on page load\n\t- `<MyComponent client:idle/>`: Hydrates the component JavaScript once the page is done with its initial load\n\t- `<MyComponent client:visible/>`: Hydrates the component JavaScript once the component has entered the user’s viewport\n\t- `<MyComponent client:media={string}/>`: Hydrates the component JavaScript once a certain CSS media query is me\n\t- `<MyComponent client:only={string}/>`: Skips HTML server rendering and renders only on the client\n\t- demo: https://astro-client-directives-test.netlify.app\n\t\t----------------------------------------\n\t\t<Layout title=\"Welcome to Astro\">\n\t\t  <main>\n\t\t\t<h1>Welcome to

Remix is created by Ryan Florence and Michael Jackson, the creators of React Router\n\t\t\t- nearly every route need to fetch data\n\t\t\t\t- React Router will call data fetches in parallel before the route is rendered\n\t\t\t\t- then access the data with the useLoaderData hook\n\t\t\t- only the data of the changing routes is loaded\n\t\t\t- has 404 pages\n\t\t\t- point a form action at a route, and add a route action\n\t\t\t\t- it works like server actions in Next.js but the examples are obviously client-side React\n\t\t\t- has optimistic UI\n\t\t\t\t- the expected value is displayed and will only change if another value is fetched\n\t\t\t- *\"It's hard to explain just how much simpler and more capable your code becomes when your router understands the full data lifecycle with data

Shared-Hosting-Server website to Hetzner\n\t- but the email address I've used for decades is also at that domain \n\t\t- I need to host that as well with an IMAP email server or whatever\n\t- the main thing is that it works \n\t\t- since this email is connected to numerous accounts where I need to receive access codes, etc.\n- asking around, got this advice\n\t- **>>> before you begin, make backup of emails**\n\t\t- [OfflineIMAP](https://www.offlineimap.org)\n\t\t\t- downloads your email mailbox(es) as local Maildirs\n\t\t\t- will synchronize both sides via IMAP\n\t\t\t- so this software is used to **synchronize** email accounts\n\t\t\t\t- which can be also used to **make a backup** of them\n\t\t\t- should run on most platforms supported by Python\n\t\t\t\t- this repository is for python2 only\n\t\t\t\t- we do not support Windows\n\t\t- [fetchmail](https://www.fetchmail.info)\n\t\t\t- like offlineimap, fetchmail is used to pull emails from a remote mail server and deliver them to a local mailbox or forward them to another email address\n\t\t\t\t- so this is in effect a **backup**\n\t\t\t- fetchmail supports **IMAP, POP3, ETRN, ODMR, and others**\n\t\t\t\t- OfflineIMAP supports only IMAP\n\t\t\t- fetchmail doesn't emphasize two-way synchronization as its primary function\n\t\t\t\t- OfflineIMAP emphasized two-way synchronization\n\t\t\t\t- for a **backup** this shouldn't be necessary anyway\n\t\t\t- fetchmail is more for simple fetching, backing up\n\t\t\t\t- OfflineIMAP for keeping mail accounts synchronous\n\t\t\t- if you want to periodically download emails from your email server and store them locally for **backup** purposes, **fetchmail** can be a suitable choice\n\t- **install an IMAP server**\n\t\t- **[DoveCot](https://www.dovecot.org)**\n\t\t\t- works with IMAP and POP3\n\t\t\t- allows users to access their email messages on a server\n\t\t\t- popular for its ability to keep messages on the server and synchronize them across multiple devices\n\t\t\t- supports encryption protocols such as SSL/TLS \n\t\t\t- supports **mbox** and **maildir** mailbox formats\n\t\t\t- includes support for [Sieve](http://sieve.info), a scripting language that allows users to define mail filtering rules on the server\n\t\t\t- can be [installed with git clone](https://doc.dovecot.org/installation_guide/compiling_source)\n\t\t\t- uses Linux accounts\n\t\t\t- you can set up an SSL certificate with **Let's Encrypt**\n\t\t\t- then you can syrnchronize your IMAP account with **[imapsync](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/doc/TUTORIAL_Unix.html)**\n\t\t\t\t- open-source command-line tool designed for synchronizing mailboxes between two IMAP servers\n\t\t- **[MailCow](https://mailcow.github.io/mailcow-docs)**\n\t\t\t- open-source software suite for hosting email services\n\t\t\t- a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for email hosting, including features such as webmail, calendaring, and contact management\n\t\t\t- often used for creating a full-featured mail server that supports multiple domains and users\n\t\t\t- I read that [mailcow supports Debian 8 (Jessie), Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) and Ubuntu LTS 16.04 (Xenial Xerus)](https://mailcow.github.io/mailcow-docs)\n\t\t\t\t- I have Debian 11 at Hetzner\n\t\t- **[Yunohost](https://yunohost.org)**\n\t\t\t- easily manage a server for your friends, association or enterprise\n\t\t\t- user-friendly interface for managing various services and applications on a server, allowing individuals and small organizations to host their own websites, email services, file storage, and more\n\t\t\t- takes care of Mailserver, Firewall, Domain and connection to apps\n\t\t\t- outside PM2/Nginx it's not recommended\n\t\t- **host IMAP-Server as Docker container**\n\t\t\t- for example a [Mailcow Container](https://docs.mailcow.email/i_u_m/i_u_m_install)\n- questions\n\t- why use imapsync with DoveCot, why not e.g. fetchmail?\n\t- Mailcow supports Debian 8, I have Debian 11, so I can't use it?\n\t- Yunohost is an operating

work differently\n\t\t- [Use vs Import in Sass: Which One Should You Choose?](https://kentwynn.com/frontend-languages/use-vs-import-in-sass-which-one-should-you-choose/kentwynn/27/03/2023) (March 2023)\n\t\t\t- you have two options: @use and @import. While both options have their advantages, @use is generally recommended over @import\n\t\t\t- by using @use, you can avoid naming conflicts, improve performance, and make your code clearer and more maintainable\n\t\t\t- with @use, you can also specify an alias for the module or file you are importing, which can help avoid naming conflicts\n\t\t\t- while @import is still supported in Sass, it is being phased out in favor of @use\n\t\t\t\t- reason: @use provides better control over namespace and the ability to specify specific pieces of code to import\n\t\t\t\t- if you are starting a new project or updating an existing one, it’s recommended to use @use instead of @import in your Sass code\n\t\t- Kevin Powell [Stop using @import with Sass | @use and @forward

it to send it back out\n\t\t\t- you can use letter or *##oneletterorstar\n\t\t\t- if you call the file index, you only need to list the folder\n\t\t- [Node-Sass or Dart-Sass : The CSS Preprocessor Dilemma](https://itnext.io/the-css-preprocessor-dilemma-node-sass-or-dart-sass-32a0a096572)\n\t\t\t- when you run the command **npm i sass**, you are installing **Dart Sass**\n\t\t\t\t- the **sass**

when using the @use rule in Sass, you are not required to use underscores in file names\n\t\t\t\t- the use of underscores in file names is a convention often associated with the older @import rule\n\t\t\t- the file is only imported once, no matter how many times you @use it in a project\n\t\t\t- variables, mixins, and functions (what Sass calls \"members\") that start with an underscore (_) or hyphen (-) are considered private, and not imported.\n\t\t\t\t- members from the used file (buttons.scss in this case) are only made available locally, but not passed along to future imports\n\t\t\t\t- @extends will only apply up the chain; extending selectors in imported files, but not extending files that import this one\n\t\t\t\t- all imported members are namespaced by

no value to using Prisma migrate\n\t\t\t\t- instead we use **db push**\n\t\t- (3) indices on foreign keys\n\t\t\t- avoid full-table scans\n\t\t\t\t- by createing indices on foreign keys\n\t- Prisma in Next.js project\n\t\t- want to connect to PlanetScale\n\t\t- shows **schema.prisma**##mmmhismine\n\t\t- a 1-to-many relation between post and comments\n\t\t- will enable the referential integrity

language\n\t\t- unlike Java which is compiled to bytecode that can run on multiple operating systems\n\t\t\t- Go is compiled to a form that can only run on a single operating system\n\t\t\t\t- if you compile for Windows, it can only be run on Windows\n\t\t\t- since it is statically typed\n\t\t\t\t- type checking is performed during the compilation process, which helps catch type errors early\n\t\t\t\t- types can be inferred but they are always known at compilation time\n\t\t\t\t- you can develop in a way that it feels like an interpreted language, but it is compiling behind the scenes\n\t\t- compiled with a statically linked runtime\n\t\t\t- but no external virtual machine\n\t\t\t\t- whereas in Java, you have a JVM\n\t\t- is Go object-oriented\n\t\t\t- yes, sort of\n\t\t\t- supported OOP\n\t\t\t\t- it has custom interfaces\n\t\t\t\t- custom **types** can implement one or more interfaces\n\t\t\t\t- \"when you add functions to a type, they are now called methods\"\n\t\t\t\t- you can create your own **structs** in Go, which have their own member fields\n\t\t\t\t\t- \"a struct is used to create complex data structures with multiple fields\"\n\t\t\t\t- so working in go has the feel of working with classes in Java and C#\n\t\t\t- unsupported OOP\n\t\t\t\t- no classes and no inheritance\n\t\t\t\t\t- no supertypes and subtypes\n\t\t\t\t- no method or operator overloading\n\t\t\t\t- no structured exception handling\n\t\t\t\t\t- no try, catch, finally\n\t\t\t\t\t- instead, error objects are returned\n\t\t\t\t- no implicit numeric
